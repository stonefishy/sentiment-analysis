# Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing technique that involves analyzing the sentiment of a text, which can be positive, negative, or neutral. It is widely used in various applications such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and opinion mining.

This code repo is base on `tensorflow` and `keras` library for building a deep learning model for sentiment analysis, the dataset used is IMDB movie review dataset. The movie review dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately predict the sentiment of a movie review. The full dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).
